## General info
Fauna is pet's digital health book, which connects pet owners and animal clinics. If the veterinary clinic uses the program, you have the opportunity to write, get reminders and see the pet's vaccinations through an app directly from veterinarians and veterinary nurses. Pet owners get a lot of information from their vet 

Pet owners want digital access to their pet's welfare, where animal clinics want a way to remind and maintain contact with its customers. At present, this is done with physical documents, such as vaccinations, medical records and health books. Fauna wants to digitize this process and develop a solution that can help pet owners and animal clinics. Fauna must act as a link and provide reminders of veterinary visits, how often and what medicine the pet should have, be a central and professional discussion forum, as well as create insight into the pet's health treatment. 

The application was written in Java using MVVM architecture pattern.
